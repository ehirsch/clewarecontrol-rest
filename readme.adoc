This is a small http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Springboot^] app written in Groovy. It provides a RESTful API for USB-devices from the _cleware GmbH_ by utilizing the clewarecontrol binary created by https://www.vanheusden.com/[Folkert van Heusden^].

== How to run

In any case you need to have at least one Cleware device connected to the host this is running on.

=== From source

Clone this repository and call

[source:bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
This will start a server on port 8080. You can check it by navigating your browser to:

 http://localhost:8080


=== From binary (you need to have java installed)

Use the download badge at the top, find the downloaded jar file and call

[source:bash]
----
java -jar clewarecontrol-rest-0.0.10.jar
----

This will start a server on port 8080. You can check it by navigating your browser to:

 http://localhost:8080

*You can even run it as a *nix service.* You simply have to follow this https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment-install.html#deployment-service[instructions^].

=== With docker

TBD

== Configuring

Simply add the desired setting as an parameter when starting the service. Here you can see how you would configure
the service to run on port 1337:

[source:bash]
----
java -jar clewarecontrol-rest-<version>.jar --server.port=1337
----

As this is a spring boot application there are quite some things you can configure. Here is a list with the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html[most common settings^].

If you need other ways of configuration - there are a lot. Just read the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[configuration reference^].


== Usage

NOTE: In a future Version (read: 0.2) this will be replaced by a 'real' usage guide using Spring-REST-Doc

For the time being there is only one endpoint:

 GET /trafficLights

Will list links to each "USB-Ampel" connected to the host running this app.

 GET /trafficLights/<id>

Will provide the state of a concrete traffic light. (<id> is the actual id of the device).

 PUT /trafficLights/<id>
 {
  "r":true|false,
  "y":true|false,
  "g":true|false
 }

Will set the state of the identified device.
